                Intuitively, those should be independent, since the first event seems to have no influence 
                on the second. In fact we can compute as follows. First 
                <span class="fragment highlight-yellow" data-fragment-index="1">$p(E_1) = 1/2$ </span>
                and
                <span class="fragment highlight-yellow" data-fragment-index="1">$p(E_2) = 1/2$ </span>
                by the symmetry of the coin tossing. Furthermore, $E_1 \cap E_2$ is the event that 
                <span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="2">the first two coins come up tails and heads</span>
                 , respectively. Since there are four equally likely outcomes for the first two coin ($HH, HT, TH$ and $TT$), 
                <span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">$p(E_1 \cap E_2)$ = 1/4</span>.Therefore 
                <span class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="4">$p(E_1 \cap E_2) = 1/4 = (1/2)\cdot(1/2) = p(E_1)p(E_2)$</span>
                , so the events are indeed 
                <span class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="5">independent</span>.

                <span class="fragment highlight-yellow" data-fragment-index="1">$p(E_1) = 1/2$</span>. 
                For $E_2$, note that there are 8 equally likely outcomes for the 
                three coins, and in 2 of these cases $E_2$ occurs (namely $HHT$ and $THH$); therefore 
                <span class="fragment highlight-yellow" data-fragment-index="2">$p(E_2) = 2/8 = 1/4$</span>. 
                Thus $p(E_1)p(E_2) = (1/2)\cdot(1/4) = 1/8$. 
                Now $E_1 \cap E_2$ is the event that 
                <span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">the first coin comes up tails, and two but not three heads come up in a row</span>. 
                This occurs precisely when the outcome is $THH$, so the probability is 
                <span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="4">1/8</span>. 
                <span class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="5">$p(E_1)p(E_2)$ = $p(E_1 \cap E_2)$</span>
                , so the events are

              You had a 1/4 chance of winning with your original selection. Just as in original problem, the
